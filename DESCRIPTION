Title: Pan-cancer multi-omics integrated analysis and visualization
Version: 0.99.0
Description: TCGA pan-cancer multi-omics data were integrated and included in this package, including gene expression TPM (transcripts per million) matrix,
    TMB (tumor mutational burden), MSI (microsatellite instability), immune cell ratio, immune score, promoter methylation, and clinical information.
    A number of functions were generated to perform pan-cancer paired/unpaired differential gene expression analysis, pan-cancer correlation analsys between
    gene expression and TMB, MSI, immune cell ratio, immune score,immune stimulator,immune inhibitor, and promoter methylation. Methods for visualization
    were provided, including paired/unpaired boxplot, survival plot, ROC curve, heatmap, scatter, radar chart, and forest plot, 
    in order to easily perform integrative pan-cancer multi-omics analysis.
